Description:

  The unity package contains complete package for the project.
  We used different shop board as clues for the game. Each team has to find 4 clues to get a final challenge.
  The challenge here was a question for coding a program. We used Vuforia SDK for this project.
  We have changed the TrackableBehaviour script in order to suit our purpose.
